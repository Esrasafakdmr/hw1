	   The city of New York is like a sum of a number of fences separated by a distinctive lifestyle and form. Manhattan, virtually identified with New York, is the economic and cultural center of New York. The most striking features of Manhattan are skyscrapers, dazzling lights and movement. Brooklyn shopping centers, where lifestyles are as varied as in Manhattan, occupy areas such as the industrial districts and the rich Brooklyn Heights, as well as the Bedford-Stuyvesant region, where poverty is widespread. The Queens, where the middle class resides, is a region where the older, more sedate neighborhoods bring fruit. The Bronx is a place where dirty jobs turn into dreary neighborhoods. The rural view of Staten Island has begun to change with recent urbanization.
