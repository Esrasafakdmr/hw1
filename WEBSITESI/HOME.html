	  Located in the state of New York, New York City is the 24-hour vibrant and dynamic city of America's largest city. New York City is also known as foreign fashion, media, art, finance and entertainment center.
	  New York is known as the city of opportunities for many people. For this reason, this city has a lot of foreign population and it is getting immigrants very large.
	  <p>Regions:
       New York City consists of five regions: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx and Staten Island.
	   </p>
	   The city of New York is like a sum of a number of fences separated by a distinctive lifestyle and form. Manhattan, virtually identified with New York, is the economic and cultural center of New York. The most striking features of Manhattan are skyscrapers, dazzling lights and movement. Brooklyn shopping centers, where lifestyles are as varied as in Manhattan, occupy areas such as the industrial districts and the rich Brooklyn Heights, as well as the Bedford-Stuyvesant region, where poverty is widespread. The Queens, where the middle class resides, is a region where the older, more sedate neighborhoods bring fruit. The Bronx is a place where dirty jobs turn into dreary neighborhoods. The rural view of Staten Island has begun to change with recent urbanization.

	There are many large companies in New York, which is the financial center of the world. In addition, there are many small businesses and factories that contribute to the economy. The clothing industry in Manhattan brings us to the most important branch of manufacturing industry even in our day. New York is also considered to be the lifeblood of the nation's mass media. The headquarters of major advertising companies with centers of national television and radio stations are also in New York.
	</p>
	<p>
	It is also famous as New York City's art, entertainment and fashion city. These events, which have been supported by numerous institutions and become almost industrialized, contribute to the emergence of new celebrities as well as the celebrity names from all over the world. The events of violence in recent years have blown this vitality. The New York Library is one of the world's leading research libraries. The city's world-class museums include the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Guggenheim Museum, the Whitney Museum, and the American Museum of Natural History.
