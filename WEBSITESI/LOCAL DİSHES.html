  <h3>
  Since the beginning of the 1900's, pizza has been brought to New York from that time, a flavor brought by Italian migrants to New York. The most important feature of the thin and soft-paced New York pizzas is light mozarella cheese and classic marinara sauce. One of the pizza experts says that New York's water dough is such a delicious decadent ingredient.
